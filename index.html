<h1>Sorry meri jaanü•∫‚ù§Ô∏è</h1>
<br >
<p>I am really sorry meri jaan. Sorry for hurting you. Sorry for every dumb mistake that I made. Sorry for every harsh word I said to you. I am sorry for my each and every action that hurt your feelings and emotions .I really dont know what to write I only know that I missed you a lot during these days and I was always unconsiously waiting for your text or I was unconsiously talking to you or thinking about you .</p>
<p>
  I just want to tell that even at the time when I said those harsh words about leaving you and throwing you out of life I never meant it .I knew that I wont be able to leave you .That was nothing but anger .I never meant to say those words it was just anger within me that made me say those words and I know those words have hurt you a lot so I am again sorry for that.
</p>
<p>
  I don't know why you always think about leaving me when i get a bit distant from you. Sometimes there's just so much going on within me that I don't want it to effect you but it still does effect you. You may not remember it but last year at this exact time I was just trying to tell you that i love you and you were just determined on leaving me because I didn't talk to you for a week because of my mdcat and my failure. At that time it effected me a lot and i didn't talk to you and you somehow believed that i dont love you and you were willing to leave me.
</p>
<p>
  Rabi sometimes I just want one thing from you that is understanding me .Can't you just understand that if I'm not talking to you then it doesn't mean that I dont love you meri jaan it sometimes mean that there is something going on or something disturbing has happened and that does not mean that at that point I just want to leave you. I may need time but why is it always you just decide to leave me during that time.
</p>
<p>Anyways the main point is that I love you and I really really missed you a lot and I am sorry for hurting you </p>
